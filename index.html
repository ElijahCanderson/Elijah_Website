      <div class="bio"> Bio</div>
      <div class="bioinfo"> I was born and raised in Porterville, California, 
        in a single-mother household where education and financial responsibility 
        were non-negotiable values. I treated school like a full-time job, graduating 
        as valedictorian of my online charter high school while serving as the primary 
        nighttime caregiver for my grandparents. The schedule was demanding—sleeping by day and staying
         alert at night—but it taught me resilience, time management, and the importance of putting family first. 
         That same commitment earned me multiple scholarship offers; I chose UC Santa Barbara for its outstanding Computer Science program. <br> <br>
         College presented new challenges. Years spent focused on academics and family had left my social skills underdeveloped, 
         but my campus job at Portola Dining Commons changed everything. Starting as a student worker and progressing through cook, 
         drinkbar, supervisor, and ultimately student manager of 160+ staff, I found mentors who became my first real friends. 
         Leading shifts that served over 2,000 customers daily sharpened my communication, conflict-resolution, and team-building abilities—skills 
         I once lacked but now consider among my greatest strengths. <br> <br>
         Financial pressures to support my mother affected my academic performance for a 
         time, yet I persevered, developing in C++, Python, dynamic programming, database design and administration, Linux systems, and full-stack web development. 
         Today, as Dining Room Supervisor at Maravilla Senior Living in Santa Barbara, I oversee front-of-house operations and serve as the de facto technician for our 
         Point-of-Sale system and its backend database. I regularly troubleshoot connectivity issues within a highly restricted firewall environment, implement solutions 
         that improve efficiency, and mentor many employees experiencing their first job—helping them grow while ensuring exceptional service for our residents.
          Every challenge I’ve faced—from caregiving and financial strain to catching up socially and technically—has reinforced the same lesson my mother instilled: 
         hard work and responsibility open doors. I bring that work ethic, technical expertise, and genuine care for people to everything I do.
